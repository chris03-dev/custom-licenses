    MRPL-derived software - software derived from existing MRPL-licensed software

                          - all output data generated by MRPL-licensed software are NOT MRPL-based
                          - 3rd party source file is a derivative and subject to the MRPL if one or more conditions satisfy:
                              - The file is wholly MRPL-licensed and modified in any way.
                              - 3rd party source file is used in conjunction with licensor's source files directly
                              modified by the entity.

Permissions Notice

    All entities obtaining a copy of this software, or its substantial parts thereof, are permitted to use, copy, modify, 
    and distribute the software, without any payments or royalties, under the following conditions:
    
    1. The above copyright notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
    2. With exception to the licensor, once the software is distributed or published in executable and/or source form, the 
    software will be considered a distribution, and the entity responsible will be associated as its distributor, subject 
    to the following conditions:
    
        2.1. All distributions, unmodified or derived, shall retain the copyright notice, its conditions, and its disclaimers.
        2.2. All unmodified distributions of the software shall retain the MRPL license encompassing the software ONLY.
        2.3. All source files used to create the binaries in distributions must be made available to the licensor in a digital 
        source format.
        
            2.3.1. If the distribution includes all of the software's source files, no additional conditions are required.
            2.3.2. Otherwise, the source files must be made available to the licensor within 14 days upon the licensor's request.
    
    3. With exception to the licensor, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the permissions notice, use of any patents and 
    trademarks in connection with the licensor's MRPL-licensed software is prohibited.
        
        2.4.1. The right to include a patent and/or trademark grant in the permissions notice is solely reserved to the licensor 
        of the software.
        2.4.2. The licensor has full responsibility to properly disclose all patents and trademarks used in the software.
        Failure to do so shall nullify any and all claims of infringement of the omitted patents and trademarks, in response
        to violations by distributors of MRPL-derived software.
        2.4.3. Use of trademarks in connection with MRPL-licensed software, if such use case is permitted, must be done in way 
        such that the distributor does not imply any affiliation with the licensor.
        2.4.4. If the patent grant is non-exclusive, subsequent distributors are allowed to exercise the patent grant in future
        distributions of the software, as long as such patent grant is included in the premissions notice of their respective
        distributions. Failure to provide the non-exclusive patent grant in the distribution, in this case, will result in 
        revocation of the patent grant from the distributor(s) complicit in such an act.
    
    4. With exception to the licensor, any act of relicensing, or dual-licensing MRPL-licensed or MRPL-derived software is
    prohibited.
    5. FAILURE TO SATISFY THE ABOVE CONDITIONS SHALL RESULT IN REVOCATION OF THE LICENSE AND ITS AFOREMENTIONED PERMISSIONS 
    PROVIDED IN THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE, AND POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE ENTITY.
