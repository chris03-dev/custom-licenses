03utils License v1.0

Definition of Terms
  
  1. "Software" shall mean any file that contains a set of instructions for the
  computer to accept input, process data and/or produce output, that can be loaded
  and executed with the use of a computer and its environment(s).
  
  2. "Dependency" shall mean any software that is produced by entities other than
  the copyright holder(s) unless explicitly stated in this license text, that is
  required for the production of, or execution of the software.
  
  3. "Environment" shall mean any interface that the computer is running in order
  to be able to execute other software, which include, but not limited to, in order
  of abstraction: emulators, virtual machines, compatibility layers, operating system
  software, and boot firmware. Environments are not considered to be dependencies.
  
  4. "Source file" shall mean any file containing human-readable abstractions of
  the software that allows for derivation of the software. They are used as input
  for build tools to produce a specific set of instructions for the software, or
  for interpreters as the instructions to be loaded and executed. In the latter
  case, they are also considered software.
  
  5. "Execution" shall mean any action performed due to a set of instructions in
  a computer or its environment(s). Such instructions must be loaded in memory
  from the software that contains them.
  
  6. "Reproduction" shall mean the duplication of data, without any modifications
  made to the resulting copy upon redistribution of the software.
  
  7. "Redistribution" shall mean the transmission of data to computers which are
  authorized for access by any entity other than the copyright holder(s) of the
  software.
  
  8. "Derivation" shall mean the addition, modification, and/or deletion of source
  files, in whole or in part(s), to modify the production of the software with the
  use of build tools, or the software itself, if the source files are used as input
  for an interpreter.
  
  9. "Build tool" shall mean any software that reads source files as input, and
  produces software as output. Build tools are considered to be dependencies, even
  if the tools are also produced by the same copyright holder(s) in the project.
  
  10. "Interpreter" shall mean any software that executes instructions by directly
  using source files as input. Similar to build tools, interpreters are considered
  to be dependencies, even if the interpreters are also owned by the project's
  copyright holder(s).
  
  11. "Contributor" shall mean any entity that has modified a project's source
  files without holding any prior copyright on the original software. Copyright
  holder(s) of a project are "contributors" for the dependencies that their
  project uses.
  
  12. "Project" shall mean a directory containing source files, as well as build
  tools for the production of the software, or interpreters for the execution of
  source files as software.
